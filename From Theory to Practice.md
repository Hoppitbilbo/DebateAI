### **From Theory to Practice: AIDebate.Tech as a Framework for Integrating Generative AI into Situated Educational Dialogues**

The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has positioned education at a pivotal juncture, presenting a landscape ripe with opportunity yet fraught with significant challenges. While the potential for GenAI to enhance learning design, provide personalized feedback, and automate content creation is widely acknowledged, a palpable sense of skeptical optimism persists within the research community (Giannakos et al., 2025). A critical disconnect exists between the theoretical models proposed for effective AI integration and the availability of practical, ethically designed, and pedagogically sound tools for classroom use. Many early studies, while promising, are accompanied by warnings about the limitations, potential for misuse, and ethical consequences of a hasty adoption of these powerful technologies. This paper argues that AIDebate.Tech, an open-source framework of educational applications, represents a significant step toward bridging this theory-practice gap. By operationalizing established learning theories—such as situated learning and dual-process reasoning—into a transparent, teacher-guided toolkit, AIDebate.Tech offers a compelling model for leveraging GenAI not as a mere information dispenser, but as a catalyst for developing the very higher-order thinking skills that its passive use can undermine.

The imperative for a structured, theory-driven approach to AI integration is a recurring theme in the scholarly discourse. The mere presence of technology is insufficient to guarantee meaningful educational transformation; rather, its value is unlocked through a deliberate rethinking of instructional design grounded in robust pedagogical principles (Messina & Panciroli, 2025). This approach is deeply rooted in the foundational work of Lave and Wenger (1991) on situated learning, which posits that knowledge is not a static entity to be transmitted but is co-constructed through active and legitimate participation within authentic contexts or "communities of practice". This perspective is echoed in contemporary educational frameworks designed for the digital age. The ESLAI (Situated Learning Episodes with AI) model, for instance, structures learning into distinct phases of anticipation, production, and restructuring, emphasizing the use of AI to create realistic scenarios that stimulate student engagement and critical reflection (Messina & Panciroli, 2025). Similarly, the TPAIK (Technological, Pedagogical, Artificial Intelligence Knowledge) framework extends the well-known TPACK model by integrating specific competencies related to AI, underscoring that educators need a synergistic understanding of technology, pedagogy, and content to harness GenAI effectively. These models collectively argue that AI's true potential is realized when it serves as a tool to create dynamic, personalized, and context-sensitive teaching practices.

It is precisely this translation of theory into practice that defines the contribution of the AIDebate.Tech platform. The framework functions as an operative toolkit that operationalizes these advanced educational concepts, moving beyond simple content generation to create structured, interactive environments for deep learning. A core tenet of its design is the principle of situated learning. Applications such as *"Convince YOU"* and *"You Impersonate"* immerse students in authentic practice, requiring them to apply knowledge within a specific historical and cultural context. In these modules, a student is no longer a passive recipient of historical facts but an active agent who must embody a figure’s worldview to construct a persuasive argument, thereby transforming learning from a declarative to a procedural exercise.

Furthermore, the platform is engineered to foster the complex critical thinking skills that unguided AI use can inadvertently suppress. A significant concern in the literature is that GenAI may encourage cognitive laziness, promoting a reliance on the rapid, intuitive, and often superficial "System 1" mode of thinking. As argued by Suriano et al. (2025), genuine critical thinking necessitates the activation of "System 2," a more deliberate, analytical, and cognitively demanding mode of reasoning, a concept grounded in the dual-process theory of Stanovich and West (2000). The applications within AIDebate.Tech are expressly designed as catalysts for this cognitive shift. Activities like *"You Moderate"* and *"Double Interview"* create scenarios of inherent intellectual friction, compelling students to mediate debates or compare divergent perspectives. This process requires the analytical evaluation of information and the recognition of valid arguments, which are hallmarks of complex critical thinking. This emphasis on active engagement aligns with large-scale empirical findings; the meta-analysis by Wang and Fan (2025) confirms that while GenAI has a large positive effect on learning performance (g=0.867), its impact is most profound within problem-based learning models (g=1.113). The interactive, problem-centric design of the AIDebate.Tech applications leverages this proven pedagogical approach to cultivate higher-order cognitive skills.

The platform's pedagogical design, however, does not conclude with the initial AI interaction. Recognizing that deep learning requires reflective consolidation, each activity culminates in a structured critical meta-reflection phase. This process is crucial for transforming experience into lasting knowledge and aligns with the "restructuring" phase of the ESLAI model (Messina & Panciroli, 2025). Upon completion of an activity, the student is met with self-assessment prompts designed to provoke a critical evaluation of the interaction, such as: "Did the AI impersonate the character well?" or "What aspects of its argument were unconvincing?" This step shifts the student's focus from task completion to a critical appraisal of the process. Moreover, the platform encourages peer learning by inviting students to draft a critical evaluation of the interaction collaboratively with a partner or to engage in collective classroom discussions. This approach fosters what is known as Socially Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL), where groups take metacognitive control of the task through negotiation and reflection (Giannakos et al., 2025). By evaluating the AI's performance, students distance themselves from the immediate experience and are prompted to reflect on their own state of learning, thereby strengthening their metacognitive competencies.

The flexibility of the platform further amplifies its pedagogical potential. As its functionality is based on integration with the Wikipedia API, the tool is inherently domain-agnostic. It is not, therefore, limited to history alone; educators can configure situated learning scenarios for any topic available within the encyclopedia. A student could be tasked with impersonating a literary character to discuss their motivations, comparing the perspectives of two geographers on an environmental issue, or moderating a debate between scientific concepts. This interdisciplinary versatility demonstrates that AIDebate.Tech's core value lies not in specific content but in the process of critical inquiry it fosters. The act of self-evaluation and metacognitive analysis is transferable across disciplines, equipping students with a set of higher-order skills applicable to a wide array of academic and real-world contexts.

Beyond its pedagogical design, AIDebate.Tech also addresses the profound ethical and practical challenges highlighted by the research community. A primary concern revolves around the need to keep human experts in the loop to mitigate risks and ensure that instruction is meaningfully contextualized. The platform is conceived as a tool for teachers to design, guide, and supervise activities, augmenting rather than replacing their expertise. This human-centered perspective is crucial for navigating the limitations of GenAI, such as its potential for generating inaccurate or biased information (Giannakos et al., 2025). Additionally, the framework responds directly to critical concerns regarding data privacy and transparency. As an open-source project that can be installed on local school servers and does not collect chat history, it offers a secure alternative to commercial platforms whose data practices may be opaque. Finally, the platform embodies a commitment to building a body of evidence through practice. The rapid evolution of GenAI necessitates strong and continuous evidence to guide its use. By providing a forum for educators to share experiments, successes, and critiques, AIDebate.Tech facilitates the collaborative, community-driven research required to build a shared understanding of how these tools can be used effectively and ethically in diverse educational settings.

### **Conclusion: An Invitation to Collaborative Experimentation**

In conclusion, the integration of generative AI into education requires more than technological innovation; it demands pedagogical deliberation and ethically grounded tools. The AIDebate.Tech framework offers a compelling model for how to thoughtfully bridge the gap between AI theory and classroom practice. It is more than a collection of applications; it is a tangible manifestation of situated learning principles, designed to actively foster the critical thinking skills necessary for navigating a complex world. By championing transparency, empowering educators, and creating a platform for collaborative research, it provides an answer to the urgent call for a more deliberate, evidence-based, and pedagogically sound approach to using AI in education.

However, the ultimate value of such a tool cannot be determined by theoretical analysis alone. The final, crucial step is empirical validation through widespread and reflective classroom use. An invitation is therefore extended to the community of educators to use and test this open-source application, to explore its potential, and to uncover its limitations within their unique contexts. The true promise of AIDebate.Tech lies in its capacity to catalyze a collective conversation. The platform is designed to encourage teachers to report on their experiences, sharing both successful best practices and the challenges encountered, in order to build a shared, practical knowledge base. This process of experimentation and dialogue is essential for ensuring that the integration of AI into education is a deliberate journey, guided by strong and continuous evidence, and ultimately, beneficial for all students.
